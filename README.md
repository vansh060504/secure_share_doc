# Secure & Share Government Documents

A secure web application for managing and sharing government documents with family members using Firebase authentication and storage. This project aims to digitize important government documents and reduce government overhead costs while ensuring secure document management.

## Problem Statement
Citizens can store important documents (mark sheets, PAN cards, passports, etc.) in digital format, reducing the risk of losing physical copies. The system links documents with Aadhaar numbers for secure identification and allows sharing with family members. This digital transformation aims to reduce government spending and make physical document copies obsolete.
